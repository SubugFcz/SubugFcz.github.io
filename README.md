# Ignatius Djaynurdin's Personal Website


Hi, this is my personal website, edited by Ignatius Djaynurdin with theme from ThemeWagon.


https://ignatiusdjaynurd.in

My path:
1. Get a domain.
2. Get a design.
3. Create new repository on GitHub.
4. Connect GitHub repo to VS Code.
5. Edit and modify the template and then commit and push.
6. Set DNS for the domain to username.github.io.
7. Set custom URL in github repo username.github.io to domain.
8. Done.
